# \[Golang\] Confusion Around `Slice` and `Array`

I found that what happens when `append`s an element to a slice is not that 
obvious, although it is actually well-defined. 

The problem I encountered with is whether `append` affects the contents of the 
"underlying" array to whom the `slice` refers. Besides, if two slices refer to 
the same array, whether `append`ing to one `slice` affects `len` and `cap` of 
another `slice`? It is certain that sometimes changing or `append`ing an element
will affect the value of another slice which shares the same underlying `array`.
That's why I have this question. 

In [Go Slices: usage and internals](https://go.dev/blog/slices-intro), it says:

> The length is the number of elements referred to by the slice. The capacity 
> is the number of elements in the underlying array (beginning at the element 
> referred to by the slice pointer)

In my first thought, it sounds like `cap` is used to describe the underlying 
`array`. Later I realize that both `cap` and the underlying array are properties
of a `slice`. `cap` is used to decides if it is safe to `append` a new element
without reallocating array.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
1. If two `slice`s share the same underlying `array`, changing one `slice`'s
content might affect the content of the other `slice`. 
2. However, it never affects the other one's `len` and `cap`. They are just
sharing the same `array`, but they have their own `len` and `cap`. 
3. When one `slice` is switching to a larger underlying array, the other `slice`
still refers the old `array`. In such situation `append` won't affect the 
content of the other `slice`.

It seems that making multiple `slice`s of a same `array` is a very error-prone
behavior.
